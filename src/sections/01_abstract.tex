%In this manuscript, we show an odd-power identity in terms of certain matrix multiplication.
%More precisely, the matrix of dimension $1 \times 1$ such that $a_{1,1} = N^{2M+1}$ is result of
%multiplication of the three matrices $\unitMatrix{N} \times \matrixK{N}{M} \times \matrixT{M}$
%\[
%    \begin{bmatrix}
%        N^{2M+1}
%    \end{bmatrix} = \unitMatrix{N} \times \matrixK{N}{M} \times \matrixT{M}
%\]
%where $\unitMatrix{N}$ is unit row vector of dimension $1 \times N$; \quad
%$\matrixK{N}{M}$ is a matrix of dimension $N \times M$,
%and $\matrixT{M}$ is a column vector of size $M \times 1$.
This manuscript establishes an odd-power identity expressed through matrix multiplication.
Specifically, we demonstrate that a \(1 \times 1\) matrix with an entry \(a_{1,1} = N^{2M+1}\)
can be represented as the product of three matrices: \(\unitMatrix{N}\),
\(\matrixK{N}{M}\), and \(\matrixT{M}\), as follows
\[
    \begin{bmatrix}
        N^{2M+1}
    \end{bmatrix} = \unitMatrix{N} \times \matrixK{N}{M} \times \matrixT{M}
\]
Here, \(\unitMatrix{N}\) denotes a unit row vector of dimension \(1 \times N\), \(\matrixK{N}{M}\)
is an \(N \times M\) matrix,
and \(\matrixT{M}\) represents a column vector of dimension \(M \times 1\).
